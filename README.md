# asm_shapes


## Introduction
This is a project I wrote when I was teaching myself assembly. It is written in 8086  
processor 16-bit DOS assembly language.

## Motivation
* The project started when found out the interrupt routine that draws a single pixel.   
 With a nested loop I was able to draw a square, a rectangle, and more and more  
 shapes.    
* I then included these algorithms in my own functions, so I was able to draw a number  
 of shapes of a variety of size and colours.  
* Added some user interaction features. The user was then able to selet what shape to draw  
 and where exactly on the screen.
